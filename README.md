## Life Is Support

This program is a simulation of ‘Particle Life’, a type of cellular automaton, where the behaviour of particles is determined by the interaction with their neighbours. The user can observe the evolution of complex patterns and structures that are formed during the simulation.

**Main Features:**

* **Visualisation:** The program displays particles as circles whose colour depends on the number of neighbouring particles. This allows you to observe the dynamics and formation of different structures.
* **Interactivity:** The user can interact with the simulation in the following ways:
    * **Scaling:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out.
    * **Camera movement:** Hold down the right mouse button and move it to move the camera around the simulation field.
* **Customisability:** You can change simulation parameters, such as particle interaction rules and colour palette, to create different effects.
* **Easy to use:** The software has an intuitive interface and requires no special skills to run and use.

**Technical details:**

* The programme is written in Java language using Swing library for graphical interface.
* A cellular automaton algorithm is used to determine particle behaviour.
* Anti-aliasing is applied to smooth the visualisation of circles.

**How to use:**

1. Compile the program: `javac ParticleLife.java`.
2. Run the programme: `java ParticleLife`.
3. Use the mouse wheel to zoom.
4. Hold down the right mouse button and move it to move the camera.

**Purpose:**

Particle Life is designed to demonstrate the principles of cellular automata and create a visually appealing simulation that allows you to observe the formation of complex structures from simple rules of interaction. It can be used for learning, entertainment, or as a basis for creating more complex simulations.

**Note:**

This programme is a basic implementation of Particle Life and can be extended and improved by adding new features such as changing simulation rules, saving and loading states, and more complex visual effects.
